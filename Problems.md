# CDE obsservations  

The project uses the data on the CDE repository. There is an extensive API that defines the Form and Cd models. 

## Data-Model disagreement  

### Elements defined in `Form`  are found in `Cd` 
Example: 
`formElements` defined in `Form` are in `Cd`, see `ctyKfVm8k_B`

### Data contain embedded HTML  
### Data contain disclaimer text 
Disclaimer text, important as it may be, needs to be removed prior to use. 

### Data elements (model classes) that do not exist in the documenation
1. `newCde`  
   This is a class not defined but is found in `Cd` data
2. x
